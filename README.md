# Functional_programming_sorting_algorithms
Famous sorting algorithms implemented in scala, using functional programming framework.

By introducing the implicit variables, lists with specific types can be sorted easily.

# Bubble Sort

The worst case time complexity and the best case time complexities are O(n^2)

Running Example;

First Pass:

( 5 1 4 2 8 ) –> ( 1 5 4 2 8 ), Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 5 > 1.

( 1 5 4 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 5 2 8 ), Swap since 5 > 4

( 1 4 5 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Swap since 5 > 2

( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5), algorithm does not swap them.

Second Pass:

( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 )

( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ), Swap since 4 > 2

( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )

( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –>  ( 1 2 4 5 8 )

Now, the array is already sorted. isSorted function returns true, so recursion breaks and sorted list is returned.

# Insertion Sort

The worst case time complexity and the best case time complexities are O(n^2)
